> A simple way of tracking items in boxes

This project was started out of a need to keep track of what is contained in boxes during a move.  My wife and I are moving to a smaller place, and will be putting lots of boxes in a storage container.  She had the idea to number all of the boxes and write down what is in each one so we would know where to find things should we need to while the boxes are in storage.  I have been teaching myself Vue.js (via vueschool.io), and thought this would be a great little project to put into Vue for learning purposes, and as a portfolio, all while having a usable application that is beneficial for us.
